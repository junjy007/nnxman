KITTI road segmentation dataset should come here.

The data is available at 
  http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip

After unpacking, you should have a directory structure as follows:

── testing
│   ├── calib
│   └── image_2
└── training
    ├── calib
    ├── gt_image_2
    └── image_2
